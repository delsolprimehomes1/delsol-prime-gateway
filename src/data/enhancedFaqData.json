      "answer": "New-build properties on the Costa del Sol offer hassle-free quality, energy efficiency, and modern luxury – combined with a flexible payment schedule. It's a smart choice for international buyers seeking lifestyle, investment value, and peace of mind.\n\n✅ Modern construction standards & guarantees: All new developments meet strict European building regulations (EPC label A/B) and come with a 10-year structural warranty – meaning lower maintenance and fewer surprises compared to older homes.\n\n🌱 Energy-efficient and future-proof: Features like heat pumps, solar panels, and aerothermal systems can cut energy costs by up to 40% – a key advantage for sustainability-conscious buyers from across Europe and beyond.\n\n💰 Staged payment plan: Typically, you pay 20–30% during construction and the remaining 60% upon completion. This allows you to invest without needing the full capital upfront.\n\n📈 Higher rental & resale value: Smart-home features, fitness areas, co-working spaces, and concierge services attract premium tenants and future buyers – with rental yields often 15–20% higher than older properties.\n\n🏖️ Lifestyle benefits: Direct flights from most European cities to Málaga ✈️, 300+ days of sunshine, world-class golf, gastronomy, and international healthcare make it more than just a real estate investment – it's a lifestyle upgrade. CostaPrimeHomes offers VIP property tours and multilingual guidance from reservation to key handover.\n\n📊 Clear and transparent taxes: New-build homes are subject to 10% VAT (instead of the 7% transfer tax on resales), making it easier to plan ahead – especially for those buying through a company structure or managing cross-border assets.",
